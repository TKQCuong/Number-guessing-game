* This is the fun game about guessing number that is created by Javascript
* User will get to choose a number between 1-100 in 30 seconds and WIN !
* There will be a feedback for users to know is they are too low or too high from the correct number.

## User Stories

The following required functionalities are completed (this is a sample):

[x] The user can attempt to guess a random integer between 1 and 100 by entering a value into a textbox.
[x] The user can press a button to check their guess, and receive feedback on whether their guess was too low, too high, or correct.
[x] After the user enters a guess, the textbox is cleared.
[x] The user sees feedback about the most recent guess in a Bootstrap alert class div. If the guess is correct, the user will see a div styled with the "success" background.
[x] The user is limited to ten guesses to guess the correct number, and can see the number of remaining guesses after each incorrect guess via a "Guesses Remaining" area.
[x] The user can restart the game by pressing a "start over" button or link.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

[x] The user can see a history of past guesses.
[x] When the user guesses the same number twice, the user receives an error message alerting them to the fact that they've already guessed that number. The number of guesses remaining should not decrease.
[x] The user is limited to 30 seconds per guess. If the user does not guess within the allotted time, the turn is lost.

## Time Spent and Lessons Learned

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total.
Learned how to think logic initially to create the "pattern"; trying and googling many ways of apply Javascript.
